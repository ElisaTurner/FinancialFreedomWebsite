    <h1>Financial Freedom is almost here!</h1>
   
    <p>
       
        Attaining financial freedom is an objective for most individuals. Financial freedom usually means having enough savings, financial investments, and cash on hand to afford the kind of life we desire for ourselves and our families. It means growing savings that enable us to retire or pursue the career we want without being driven by earning a set salary each year. Financial freedom means our money is working for us rather than the other way around.  
        <br /> <br />

        We are burdened with increasing debt, monetary emergencies, profligate spending, and other problems that hinder us from reaching our objectives. Such challenges confront everybody, but these calculators will put you on the right track! 
       <br /> <br />
        We all know the feeling—the panic that sets into your stomach when you see the bill for an unexpected car repair. How are we going to pay for that? But what if a car repair was just an inconvenience? Instead of worrying, you pay the bill without thinking twice. A week later you’ve forgotten that it even happened! That’s how little it affects your financial situation. It’s not an emergency. It’s barely a hiccup!
    <br /> <br />

     The next time a pandemic or recession hits and you miss a monthly paycheck, instead of panic and relying on the government, you’ve got a safety net. You can focus on the other inconveniences of the crisis, not where your family’s next meal is going to come from.
    Do you feel that sense of relief? That’s what financial freedom feels like.
